Designation,Purpose,,,,
Flood Frequency Site,Will be used to determine flood frequencies and magnitudes.,,,,
Flood Forecasting Site,Will be used for forecasting flood events and are important for public safety.,,,,
SW Assessment Site,"Will be used to improve UIFs (Unimpaired Flows) for model development as part of the State's Surface Water Assessment Project.  These UIFS are used to develop inflows to the surface water allocation models being developed by the SCDNR, SCDHEC, and a consultant (CDM Smith).",,,,
POR Site,Period of Record (for reactivation sites only) - site has 20 or more years of historic data from which to compare new streamflow data.,,,,
DNR Fisheries Site,"Will be used by SCDNR biologists for monitoring and  fisheries assessment, management and protection.",,,,
Coastal Studies Site,Will help define location of the saltwater/freshwater interface and help determine rate of salt water intrusion.,,,,
WU/Regulation Site,"Site is regulated or has impairment (downstream of a reservoir, noteable water use/withdrawals, ect.), and data will be used to assess water availability concerns.",,,,
DOT Site,Will be at a bridge crossing and will address DOT infrastructure and transportation concerns.,,,,
Water Quality,Will be used to monitor water quality,,,,
Ecological,Will be used to monitor and study a stream of noted ecological value or concern,,,,
"Other purposes include the general lack of data availability on a mainstem, a major tributary, or in a particular part of a basin. Though not listed explicitly, many of the proposed sites can also be used for low flow studies (7Q10 estimates, for example) or for drought monitoring.",,,,,
